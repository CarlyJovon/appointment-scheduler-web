## 3. Simple Data Model

Since we're focusing on the frontend, we'll define a data structure that could be stored in localStorage or that would interface well with a backend API:

**Business:**
```javascript
{
  id: "unique-id",
  name: "Business Name",
  description: "Short description",
  phone: "555-123-4567",
  email: "business@example.com",
  address: "123 Main St, City, State ZIP",
  logo: "url-to-logo.jpg",
  businessHours: [
    { day: "Monday", start: "09:00", end: "17:00", closed: false },
    { day: "Tuesday", start: "09:00", end: "17:00", closed: false },
    // More days...
  ]
}
```

**Services:**
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "service-1",
    name: "Haircut",
    description: "Basic haircut service",
    duration: 30, // in minutes
    price: 25.00,
    category: "Hair"
  },
  // More services...
]
```

**Appointments:**
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "appt-1",
    clientId: "client-1",
    serviceId: "service-1",
    date: "2025-04-30",
    startTime: "10:00",
    endTime: "10:30",
    status: "confirmed", // or "cancelled", "completed"
    notes: "Client prefers scissors only"
  },
  // More appointments...
]
```

**Clients:**
```javascript
[
  {
    id: "client-1",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "555-987-6543",
    notes: "Prefers afternoon appointments"
  },
  // More clients...
]
```

## 4. Basic Workflow

1. **Business Setup:**
   - Business owner enters their information and business hours
   - Business owner adds services they offer

2. **Client Booking Flow:**
   - Client visits the booking page
   - Client selects desired service
   - System shows available time slots based on business hours and existing appointments
   - Client selects time slot and provides contact information
   - Client receives confirmation message

3. **Appointment Management:**
   - Business owner views upcoming appointments in calendar view
   - Business owner can edit or cancel appointments
   - System sends notifications for changes

4. **Client Management:**
   - Business records basic client information with appointments
   - Business views client history and notes for better service

## 5. Technical Considerations for Frontend

- **Alpine.js for Interactivity:**
  - Handle form validation
  - Manage data binding for appointments and services
  - Handle date calculations and availability logic
  - Implement filtering and search functionality

- **TailwindCSS for UI:**
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
  - Consistent styling for forms, buttons, and calendar components
  - Custom styling for business branding

- **Data Management:**
  - Use localStorage for MVP to store business data, services, and appointments
  - Structure data for easy migration to backend API later

- **Libraries to Consider:**
  - A date picker library compatible with Alpine.js
  - A simple calendar view library
  - Form validation helpers
